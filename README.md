## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations:
Search and Filter Functionality: Implement search and filter options to allow users to explore astronomy images and videos based on specific criteria, such as keywords, categories, or astronomical objects.

Save and Favorites Feature: Introduce a "save" or "favorites" functionality that allows users to bookmark or save their favorite astronomy images or videos for future reference.

Sharing Options: Incorporate sharing capabilities to enable users to share astronomy images or videos with others through social media, email, or other messaging platforms.
